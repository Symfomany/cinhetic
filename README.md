Cinhetic Standard Edition
========================

Welcome to the Cinhetic Standard Edition - a fully-functional Symfony2
application that you can use as the skeleton for your new applications.

1) Installing the Cinhetic Standard Edition
----------------------------------

When it comes to installing the Cinhetic Standard Edition, you have the
following options.

### Use Composer (*recommended*)

As Symfony uses [Composer][2] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `create-project` command to generate a new Symfony application:

    php composer.phar create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition path/to/install
