Simple Twitter Tweets - Display your Tweets on your Wordpress site using the new Twitter OAuth API v1.1. (even when you can't connect) Because they're backed up!

== Description ==

A Simple Twitter Tweets display widget, using Twitter OAth and API v1.1 and backup up so it always displays your Tweets.

**Why?**

Our clients, especially on shared hosting were having issues with the Twitter API not displaying their tweets, too many connections from the same source (host). We solved that issue, then lo and behold Twitter changed their API so displaying your own Tweets required OAuth authentication and finally we buckled and decided to roll our own so it would be simple for them, for us and for you.

Twitter changed their API again. Removing version 1.0 of the API altogether and by forcing version 1.1 of the API and use of the OAuth authentication requirement. We wrote this plugin so everyone could have it at a click of a button.

There are a few Twitter plugins out their, but we couldn't find one simple enough, or that worked (to be honest) and so the Simple Twitter Tweets plugin was born.

Twitter users who want to display their Tweets on their website (or within an application) have to create a Twitter Application to get access to the required "Keys" and "Tokens" Twitter provides for Authentication. The instructions for this are provided below so you can be up and running with Tweets on your site in less time than it takes to make a cup of Tea.

= Features =

* Simple setup
* Twitter API v1.1 compliant (OAuth Ready)
* No passwords required or used
* Works even when Twitters down, over capacity or not connecting
* Tweets stored in the database with each call, so if your call to the Twitter API fails for whatever reason there won't be a blank space or Oops message on your site, you'll just see the last set of Tweets the system stored - sweet huh.
* Tweeted when? - In Human Time using minutes, hours and days (i.e. 5 hours ago) or using Twitter time display (i.e. 5h)
* Twitter intents - increase social interaction with users ability to Reply, Retweet and Favourite your tweets right from you page
* Twitter intents using bespoke (only three characters) icon font (tiny) and colour the icons right in the widget
* Did we say it was simple and works...

== Installation ==

Installation is as simple as 1,2,3 or maybe 4 because of Twitter :)

1. Upload 'simple-twitter-tweets' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the Widget to your page (e.g. Sidebar) and update the required details
4. Click Save
5. Note: You will need to create a Twitter Application - See below. Oh, it's really easy.

= Creating a Twitter Application =

The Twitter Widget will never ask for your password, as it gets all your required data from the Open Authentication keys and secrets you will get by creating your application at Twitter. It also means that if you change your password, you won’t need to update any of the details of your Widget.

To find these details, go to https://dev.twitter.com/ and sign in.

Once you have logged in successfully, hover over your name in the top right corner, and click "My Applications," then "Create a New Application."

Enter a unique name (anything you want), a description (again this is just for you), and your site's URL. You can leave the Callback URL empty as it is not used for this implementation.

Yay, success - OK! You will be taken to a new screen, there's one more step then you can copy all the details into correct fields of the Widget and be on your way.

OK, click the "Create my Access Token" button. This is a shortcut to authenticate your own account with your application (so you never need use your password).

Good. Now click the Details Tab as all the information you need is presented hereso you can just copy the required information into the exact corresponding inputs fields of the Widget.

Full details and screenshots of this process can seen on the [Simple Twitter Tweets page](http://www.planet-interactive.co.uk/simple-twitter-tweets "Simple Twitter Tweets page by Planet Interactive")

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the look and feel of the Tweets =

Of course you can. It's really simple too.

The Tweets are in a widget as with all widgets, and are a simple unordered list.

* To make styling easier the &lt;ul&gt; has a class of Tweets - &lt;ul class="tweets"&gt;
* Each Tweet is a list item &lt;li&gt;
* Each Time reference is an emphasised link &lt;em&gt;&lt;a&gt;
* Inside the &lt;li&gt; we now have (if you choose to diplay it) the avatar image
* Inside the &lt;li&gt; we also have (if you choose to diplay them) the Twitter intents. These are are in a DIV with a class of 'intent-meta' – in case you want to control its placement or spacing further. Each Intent is a link containing a 'span' for icon (using icon fonts for speed and styling flexibility) and another span for the text
* Done.
